# Pattern Recognition - NLP Project CSE 555
This is a collaborated repository of Ramanathan, Harshitha reddy and Rakshitha for Pattern Recognition course Project

This project is an IMDB movie review sentiment analysis with LSTM, GRU, and BERT models using PyTorch.

Data Set: It contains 47693 sentences, each tagged with a sentiment type, such as positive, negative and neutral sentence.

Model: The objective of this research is to do a sentiment analysis using bidirectional LSTM, LSTM, GRU and BERT on content we scraped and stored in .csv regarding movie review. We also compare the findings with Decison Tree, Random Forest, and Gradiant Boosting models. We use NLP pre-processing techniques in our proposed approach to better accuracy than the existing generic models.
